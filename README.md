extract_coords.pl is a script that will extract the xyz data from the pdb file for a specific virus.

makeicos.pl takes the pdb file containing the AU of a virus and duplicates it over and over until it completes the full icosahedral virus

pdb_info.pl is a script that is useful for getting info about the makeup of certain viruses from their pdb files. Counts atoms per protein chain, number of chains, etc. 

These scripts can be found at https://github.com/srizzolo/Wilson-Group and can be downloaded individually or in terminal using 'git clone git@github.com:srizzolo/Wilson-Group.git' in Terminal
